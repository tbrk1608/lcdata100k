In this project, I analyzed data from the year 2013-2015 of Lending Club with 100K observations. The goal is to develop different models to predict which loans are at risk of default. Different models - Decision Trees, Random Forest, Boosting models, linear models were built to predict the default rate of loans and devise an investment strategy.
